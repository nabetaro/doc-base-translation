  * fix a bug introduced in last version, thanks to bug hunting by 
    David Kimdon; closes: #171202

 -- Adam Di Carlo <aph@debian.org>  Sun,  1 Dec 2002 17:30:05 -0500

 -- Adam Di Carlo <aph@debian.org>  Mon, 25 Nov 2002 13:36:24 -0500

doc-base (0.7.11) unstable; urgency=low

  * incorporate NMU (closes: #111703, #114657)
  * strengthen the wording of the prerm case -- for people getting 
      dpkg: warning - unable to delete old file `directory': Directory not empty
    due to old .dhelp files, please read section 2.4
    (closes: #59850)
  * some other minor updates in the documentation
  * debian/control: upgrade to standards version to 3.5.6, no changes
    needed 

    - Note that the stipulation that programs cannot reference files in
      /usr/share/doc [13.3] is not honored because that is required by
      dhelp; complaints about that should be directed towards dhelp.

    SGML aesthetics and tagging

 -- Adam Di Carlo <aph@debian.org>  Tue,  8 Feb 2000 20:07:16 -0500

doc-base (0.7.7) unstable; urgency=low

  * really update Policy standards to 3.0.1
  * dhelp now has a different program, dhelp_parse_fsstnd, to deal with
    /usr/doc vs /usr/share/doc, so use it
  * debian/control: conflict with dhelp (<< 0.3.14)
  * prerm, postinst: implement tech committe solution on /usr/doc symlink

 -- Adam Di Carlo <aph@debian.org>  Fri, 10 Sep 1999 21:37:01 -0400

doc-base (0.7.5) unstable; urgency=low

  * update Policy standards to 3.0.1
  * debian/rules: move documentation area back to /usr/doc for now;
    clean is a bit cleaner
  * maintainer scripts: simplify a bit; call 'install-docs -r' from
    preinst for upgrade from 0.7.4 (dir move) to avoid the dpkg warning
    (closes Bug#41785, #41161, #41326)
  * install-docs: prior to installing new docreg file, remove any already
    installed dhelp files -- this will help with the /usr/doc ->
    /usr/share/doc transition, although it won't suppress the dpkg
    warning, since 'install-docs -i' runs *after* the warning
  * doc-base.sgml: talk about how to avoid the dpkg warning about
    'Directory not empty' due to .dhelp file left around during upgrade;
    the solution in short is to run 'install-docs -r' during 'upgrade' in
    prerm

 -- Adam Di Carlo <aph@debian.org>  Sat, 14 Aug 1999 21:32:55 -0400

doc-base (0.7.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/control: removed perl-base dependancy -- it's required!

doc-base (0.7.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * doc-base.sgml: fix typo (closes Bug#35986)
  * install-docs: only warn about unknown formats if verbose ('-v') is in
    effect (closes Bug#33509, Bug#35947, and hopefully quells the recent
    outcry on debian-devel)
  * debian/rules: debiandoc2text now has a default extension of .txt,
    which is better anyway, so use that

 -- Adam Di Carlo <aph@debian.org>  Thu, 13 May 1999 01:25:06 -0400

 -- Adam P. Harris <aph@debian.org>  Mon,  1 Jun 1998 01:49:50 -0400

doc-base (0.7.0) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * maintainer scripts: one of the shell function used '-', which was
    renamed to '_'; shell for maintainer scripts set back to /bin/sh
  * doc-base.sgml: update the FSF address
  * copyright: list myself as maintainer
  * bump standards version to 2.4.1.0 (checked)
  * add digit to version number: 0.7.x will be for hamm maintenance
    (branched); probably 0.8 will be for our documentation drafts
    including information on the Debian Document Hierarchy, the new docreg 
    file format documentation and system, and other documents; 0.9 will
    probalby contain our implementations of these new infrastructures for
    slink; and eventually it'll all be a done deal and we'll hit 1.0.

  * fix minor problems with the new install-docs-man document id, the
    document id was misnamed install-doc-man
  * improve the maintainer scripts immensely, trying to minimize removal,
    since it's not necessary to remove a document id when replacing it
  * doc-base.sgml: update TODO list

 -- Adam P. Harris <aph@debian.org>  Fri, 17 Apr 1998 01:17:06 -0400

doc-base (0.4) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * much better dhelp support: be sure to run 'dhelp_parse -d' before
    altering a .dhelp file, multiple <item>s in one .dhelp file, and very
    good parsing of existing .dhelp files in case more than one
    document-id is adding a files in the same directory (closes
    Bug#18808, Bug#20038, Bug#20529)
  * we now will modify even foreign .dhelp files
  * lowercase sections for dhelp (only), and remove leading 'Apps/', which
    is a workaround until we have a real, policy-specified and thought-out
    documentation hierarchy (closes Bug#20862)
  * register install-docs man page, html version
  * moved Section for our own documentation from Apps/Programming to
    Debian

  * debian/rules: clarifications and cleanup
  * added frozen to distribution ("oopsie" on last version)
  * install-docs is idempotent for --remove, that is, if you try to remove
    a docid which is already removed, it exits with a warning, but not a
    non-zero exit status (closes Bug#19875, I think)

 -- Adam P. Harris <aph@debian.org>  Thu,  9 Apr 1998 20:36:00 -0400

doc-base (0.2) unstable; urgency=low
