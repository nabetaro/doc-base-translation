doc-base (0.9.6~3) UNRELEASED; urgency=low
 
  * Applied a bit modified patch from  Martin Pitt @ Ubuntu to remove dependency
    on perl (closes: #602919):
    + Scrollkeeper.pm: provide our own local dirname() function and use it 
      instead of File::Basename;
    + InstallDocs.pm: use the `rm -r' and 'mkdir -p' programs instead of 
      File::Path;
    + debian/rules: run dh_perl with '-d' to avoid perl dependency. 

  * Switch internal databases format from MLDBM to YAML and provide better 
    error recovery from database corruption:
    + DB.pm: use YAML::Tiny module for stroing our internal databases;
    + Util.pm: introduce Fatal() function and differentiate exit codes
      by type of error;
    + make the Fatal() function call 
    + debian/control: switch dependency on libmdlbm-perl to libyaml-tiny-perl;
    + debian/postinst: try to recover for yaml files corruption by deleting 
      them and re-spawning install-docs.
  
  * Translations handling:  
    + patch from David Pr√©vot not to assume word ordering in translated 
      strings (closes: #606475). 
    + patch from Chris Leick to fix plurals in the strings (closes: #521384).
    + mark more doc-base messages as translatable;
    + Update Polish translation of binary.

  * doc-base.sgml:
    + prepend a top-level section name section names to make it more visible 
      that sections' componets are separated by slash (closes: #578331).

      notified of installs/removals of rarian-compat
  * DocBaseFile.pm: fix `no valid Format found' check.
  * Scrollkeeper.pm: avoid `unsuccessful stat on file contains new line' 
    warnings given by perl (closes: #607498, #614330).

  * Ubuntu bugs handling:
    + install-docs.in: check if the Pod::Usage module is available before 
      using it (LP: #431270, #510976);
    + this version gets rid of MLDBM and provides a better handling of
      databases corruption, to prevent `read error' bugs 
      (LP: #695319, #675069, #672364, #668856, #652102, #621345);
    + debian/prerm: downgrade the `cannot find install-docs on path' error
      to a warning to make it possible to remove doc-base when install-docs
      is not available for some reason (LP: #391464);
    + the `/usr/share/doc-base/data/doc-base.map' file is provided in the
      package, it must have been deleted either manually or by filesystem
      error (LP: #660345, #646629);
    + close bugs that are duplicates of Debian bug#501874, fixed in 0.8.18
      (LP: #247718, #249160, #250252, #314996, #327101, #327104).

doc-base (0.8.18) unstable; urgency=medium

  * install-docs.in: include $opt_rootdir in used vars not to fail when
    Perl is in unusable state (closes: #501874). In such a case install-docs
    should try to recover on next invocation (see entry for version 0.8.4)

 -- Robert Luberda <robert@debian.org>  Sun, 16 Nov 2008 22:34:09 +0100

doc-base (0.8.17) unstable; urgency=low

  * doc-base.map: add a few self-mappings to prevent install-docs from
    incorrectly changing case of characters in sections like Help/HOWTO
    (without such a mapping the section name is turned into Help/Howto).
  * postinst: re-register all docs for the above change to be propagated.
  * DocBaseFile.pm: ignore dpkg temporary files while iterating through
    /usr/share/doc-base dir contents.
  * Document.pm: remove doc-base file entry from files.db database even
    if the relevant document is not registered.
  * Scrollkeeper.pm: fix dates in generated omf files.
  * Standards-Version: 3.8.0 (no changes).

 -- Robert Luberda <robert@debian.org>  Tue, 11 Nov 2008 11:19:02 +0100

doc-base (0.8.13) experimental; urgency=low

  * Remove dpkg-triggers call from prerm and always register changed files
    in postinst.
  * InstallDocs.pm:
    + change behaviour of `-R' option to unregister doc-base files by removal
      of our databases. This could be useful if database gets damaged;
    + get Document-Id of removed doc-base files from files.db;
    + show nicer statistics about install-docs actions.
  * DocBaseFile.pm: remove PARSE_* variables.
  * doc-base.sgml: minor update, fix typos.
  * install-docs.in: don't print debugging info about skipping install-docs run.
  * control: bump conflict with dwww.
  * Merge changes from  0.8.10.1.

 -- Robert Luberda <robert@debian.org>  Wed, 23 Apr 2008 22:46:50 +0200

doc-base (0.8.12) experimental; urgency=low

  * Enhance doc-base dpkg's triggers support. Instead of simply re-registering
    all available files, install-docs, when triggered, will find out names of
    removed, changed or added /u/s/doc-base/* files and take appropriate
    action on them.

  * Change format of internal database of registered documents from plain
    text files to DBM files (managed with GDBM_File and MLDBM):
    + add new DB.pm module to provide access to database;
    + move contents of old *.status files to new status.db;
    + save timestamps and document-ids of registered /u/s/doc-base/* files
      in a new files.db database;
    + the timestamps will be saved even for broken doc-base files, that
      cannot be properly registered;
    + make necessary changes in our other *.pm to support the new databases.

  * install-docs.in:
    + add new --install-changed option, which compares contents of the files.db
      database with contents of /u/s/doc-base dir and registers only changed
      files; use this option for processing trigger in postinst;
    + new --dump-db option for debugging our databases;
    + update POD docs.

  * InstallDocs.pm: print some additional messages to give clue what is
    actually being done.
  * DocBaseFile.pm, Document.pm: refactor function names.
  * debian/control: add dependency on libmldbm-perl and build-dependency on
    libmldbm-perl and libperl-uuid.
  * debian/preinst: remove old plain text databases, call dpkg-trigger.
  * debian/postinst: don't process triggers until our databases exist.

 -- Robert Luberda <robert@debian.org>  Tue, 08 Apr 2008 22:07:06 +0200

doc-base (0.8.11) experimental; urgency=low

  * Make use of the new dpkg triggers feature:
    + provide debian/triggers file;
    + change postinst to reinstall all docs on trigger activation;
    + install-docs is now no-op if called from other packages' installation
      or removal scripts;
    + remove obsolete (created by doc-base << 0.8.7) dhelp/scrollkeeper files
      in preinst rather than in postinst.

  * Document.pm: remove a perl warning issued on removal doc-base files that
    have been already deleted.
  * Scrollkeeper.pm: switch from scrollkeeper-gen-seriesid to UUID.pm.
  * Dwww.pm: call dwww-build-menu directly (without update-menus).

  * debian/control:
    + add dependency on dpkg (>= 1.14.17) and libperl-uuid;
    + move scrollkeeper from Depends to Suggests field.

  * doc-base.sgml:
    + add OCaml as an example sub-section of Programming (closes: #472501);
    + add TODO entry related to triggers support.

doc-base (0.8.10.1) unstable; urgency=high

  * DocBaseFile.pm: workaround Perl crash by decreasing maximum length of
    line that is checked for non-UTF-8 chars (closes: #477512).

 -- Robert Luberda <robert@debian.org>  Wed, 23 Apr 2008 22:26:54 +0200

doc-base (0.8.10) unstable; urgency=low

  * doc-base.sgml:
    + define real section hierarchy (closes: #109431), strongly based on the
      menu one with a few doc-base specific sections added;
    + doc-base files should be UTF-8 encoded.
    + review TODO list.
  * DocBaseFile.pm:
    + try to recode files to UTF-8 at install time,
    + warn on unknown doc-base sections.
  * Utils.pm: Remove latin1 encoding support from HTMLEncode.
  * While reregistering all documents run `dhelp_parse -r' to avoid index++
    runs.
  * Build with debhelper v6.

doc-base (0.8.8) unstable; urgency=low

  * Remove /var/lib/doc-base on package removal (closes: #454069).
  * Strip Apps and Applications prefixes from Section field values.
  * Enable dhelp registration, conflicts with dhelp << 0.6.5.
  * Standards-Version: 3.7.3 (no changes).

 -- Robert Luberda <robert@debian.org>  Sat, 22 Dec 2007 13:22:11 +0100

doc-base (0.8.7) unstable; urgency=low

  * Introduce /var/lib/doc-base/documents and dynamic generation of files
    there in doc-base control file format.  Interfaces like dhelp, dwww,
    or doc-central should use that dir instead  of /usr/share/doc.
  * Add support for merging control files to allow multiple binary packages
    provide the same documentation but in different formats.
  * Try to standardise values of the Section: field.
  * Add /etc/doc-base/documents in order to made it possible to register
    local documents with doc-base  (closes: #213847).

  * Dhelp.pm:
    + don't generate .dhelp files, since dhelp 0.6 no longer supports them.
    + add a code to register/unregister doc-base control files with dhelp,
      but not enable it yet.

  * postinst: Remove all already generated .dhelp files and re-register
    installed documentation files.
  * Documentation update.

 -- Robert Luberda <robert@debian.org>  Sun, 02 Dec 2007 14:18:25 +0100

doc-base (0.8.6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Rewrite Dhelp.pm to improve performance and minimise number dhelp_parse
    calls, which after its reimplementation in Ruby started to be extremely
    slow (it took `install-docs -I' ages to finish). Now, dhelp_parse will
    be called at most two times in each install-docs invocation.
  * Use 3-args open(), and also quote fields' values in our status file in
    order not to fail on control files containing spaces (closes: #444889).
  * Implement more checks of doc-base files, like unknown fields, duplicated
    fields, fields in wrong sections (closes: #423120). Turn them into
    warnings, since if they are errors, too many packages will fail to
    install.
  * Document.pm: try to minimise number of write_status_file() calls.
  * Ignore SIGINT and some other signals while doing critical operations.
  * Scrollkeeper.pm: scrollkeeper doesn't like `&' character (see bug#429847),
    replace it with `(and)'.
  * More code refactoring, but still not finished: use prototypes, fix typos,
    standardise messages, etc.

 -- Robert Luberda <robert@debian.org>  Sun, 28 Oct 2007 12:00:37 +0100

doc-base (0.8.5) unstable; urgency=low

  * DocBaseFile.pm: don't die() on invalid doc-base files (closes: #425686).
  * Fix a typo in Dhelp.pm.
  * Document the Author field (closes: #427794).

 -- Robert Luberda <robert@debian.org>  Tue, 17 Jul 2007 00:47:07 +0200

doc-base (0.8.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Split install-docs into modules to make the code more manageable.
  * Try to avoid bugs like #278495: if our modules can't be loaded when
    (de)registering documentation files, create special flag file and
    re-register all the documents after install-docs is usable again.
  * Add support for (de)registering multiple documents in one install-docs
    invocation (closes: #114692).
  * Add --check/-c option to install-docs (closes: #35895), also add --rootdir
    option.
  * Remove `Registered-to-XXX' statuses, remove *.list files, deprecate the
    -L/--listfiles option. Names of the generated files are now keep in
    the status file in `Scrollkeeper-omf-files' and `Dhelp-files'  fields.
  * Change semantics of -r/--remove option: its arguments should be the names
    of previously installed doc-base files, and not the documents IDs. Still
    support the old semantics for backward compatibility.
  * Introduce -I/--install-all, -R/--remove-all, -d/--debug, -h/--help options.

  * Change the build system, create Makefile and let it do all the work.

  * doc-base.sgml:
    + Update output of --status, remove reference to --listfiles.
    + Add chapter about checking syntax of control files.
    + Update syntax of --remove option.

  * Dhelp support:
    + Pass a list of all registered files to dhelp (closes: #128493).
    + Create dhelp files only in top-level documentation dirs
      (i.e. /usr/share/doc/$package instead of /u/s/d/$package/something).
      According to dhelp's documentation this is the right thing to do.
      Also this should avoid problems with symlinks like #21678.
    + Add a special `x-doc-base-id' tag to generated dhelp files to make it
      possible to distinguish items in the dhelp files. When installing new
      documents existing files are no longer overwritten (closes: #204195),
      but on the other hand on documents removal the dhelp files may not be
      removed, which possibly reintroduces bugs like #59850.
    + Don't call dhelp_parse {-d,-a} on files that weren't changed.

  * Scrollkeeper support:
    + Fix broken non-empty directories check.
    + Save generated series id in `Scrollkeeper-sid' status field and use it
      for following registrations of the same document.
    + Call scrollkeeper-update only once in each invocation of install-docs.

  * Dwww support:
    + skip running update-menus if dwww package doesn't seem to be installed.

doc-base (0.8.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * Merge the scrollkeeper stuff from Ubuntu 0.7.21ubuntu2 (closes: #418412)
    with the following changes:
    + set omf dir to /var/lib/doc-base/omf and make it link from
       /usr/share/omf/doc-base;
    + try to register more formats in addition to html, both khelpcenter and
      yelp can handle them via external applications. Thanks to Sam Morris
      <sam+robots.org.uk> for the suggestion;
    + suggest yelp | khelpcenter as scrollkeeper browsers;
    + don't run scrollkeeper-update if --no-update-menus was passed to
      install-docs.

  * Improve the doc-base manual:
    + enhance the document layout, add some cross references;
    + remove the paragraph about automatic conversions between formats, it's
      not true, and won't be soon (unless someone provides me patch for this);
    + put an example of PDF and other supported formats (closes: #409121);
    + clarify allowable shell glob patterns (closes: #392587);
    + mention that the registered files should be located under /usr/share/doc
      hierarchy (closes: #333648);
    + review the TODO list, add some items I'd like to implement shortly.

  * postinst/postrm scripts:
    + do proper quoting of file names (closes: #395824);
    + reinstall_docs removes installed docs before re-registering them;
    + make the handling docs code from postrm match the postinst code;

  * install-docs:
    + `missing Index field for Info format' is an error now, not warning;
    + if glob() returns only one file, check for its existence. glob() seems
      to simply return its argument if it doesn't contain any meta-characters;
    + skip any doc-base files that contain Version: field, for future changes;
    + ignore `two many arguments' error for `-i' and `-r' options;

  * Move debhelper to Build-Depends (lintian)
  * Remove one useless lintian override and add two new ones ;)
  * Bump Standards-Version to 3.7.2.

doc-base (0.7.21) unstable; urgency=low

  * doc-base.sgml:
    + bless a few documentation formats: PDF, PostScript, Info, and DVI,
      which are already often used in the doc-base files
    + the `Index' field is required for the Info format.
  * install-docs:
    + support the above mentioned formats
    + warn if info format lacks the `Index' field.
  * install-docs: Some fixes for dhelp support:
    + when registering the doc files, don't remove the old .dhelp file until
      it's actually read and parsed. This partially fixes Bug#204195 (the full
      fix would probably require not removing .dhelp files when doc-base documents
      are unregistered)
    + don't HTML-encode entries already read from .dhelp file
    + made 'howto' and 'faq' section names  uppercase.
  * debian/postinst: Re-register all the doc-base files.

    + add the missing word (closes: #289448)
  * install-docs:

    + correctly handle the verbatim text and blank line for the .dhelp files
    + warn if files referred by the doc-base files does not exist.

  * fix a bug introduced in last version, thanks to bug hunting by
    David Kimdon; closes: #171202
  * dhelp registration was busted in 0.7.13, so if we're upgrading from
    that version, take the time to re-register all docreg files

 -- Adam Di Carlo <aph@debian.org>  Sun,  1 Dec 2002 17:30:05 -0500

doc-base (0.7.13) unstable; urgency=low

  * documentation corrections and updates from Chris Tillman;
    closes: #130054

    re-registering

    gratuitous bugs here while I'm working on the redesign

 -- Adam Di Carlo <aph@debian.org>  Mon, 25 Nov 2002 13:36:24 -0500

doc-base (0.7.11) unstable; urgency=low

  * incorporate NMU (closes: #111703, #114657)
  * strengthen the wording of the prerm case -- for people getting
      dpkg: warning - unable to delete old file `directory': Directory not empty

    (closes: #59850)
  * some other minor updates in the documentation
  * debian/control: upgrade to standards version to 3.5.6, no changes
    needed

    - Note that the stipulation that programs cannot reference files in
      /usr/share/doc [13.3] is not honoured because that is required by
      dhelp; complaints about that should be directed towards dhelp.

    (closes: Bug#53261)
  * tweak preinst wording as it removes old .dhelp files

    SGML aesthetics and tagging

doc-base (0.7.7) unstable; urgency=low

  * really update Policy standards to 3.0.1
  * dhelp now has a different program, dhelp_parse_fsstnd, to deal with
    /usr/doc vs /usr/share/doc, so use it
  * debian/control: conflict with dhelp (<< 0.3.14)
  * prerm, postinst: implement tech committee solution on /usr/doc symlink

doc-base (0.7.5) unstable; urgency=low

  * update Policy standards to 3.0.1
  * debian/rules: move documentation area back to /usr/doc for now;
    clean is a bit cleaner
  * maintainer scripts: simplify a bit; call 'install-docs -r' from
    preinst for upgrade from 0.7.4 (dir move) to avoid the dpkg warning
    (closes Bug#41785, #41161, #41326)
  * install-docs: prior to installing new docreg file, remove any already
    installed dhelp files -- this will help with the /usr/doc ->
    /usr/share/doc transition, although it won't suppress the dpkg
    warning, since 'install-docs -i' runs *after* the warning
  * doc-base.sgml: talk about how to avoid the dpkg warning about
    'Directory not empty' due to .dhelp file left around during upgrade;
    the solution in short is to run 'install-docs -r' during 'upgrade' in
    prerm

 -- Adam Di Carlo <aph@debian.org>  Sat, 14 Aug 1999 21:32:55 -0400

  * debian/control: removed perl-base dependency -- it's required!

  * doc-base.sgml: fix typo (closes Bug#35986)
  * install-docs: only warn about unknown formats if verbose ('-v') is in
    effect (closes Bug#33509, Bug#35947, and hopefully quells the recent
    outcry on debian-devel)
  * debian/rules: debiandoc2text now has a default extension of .txt,
    which is better anyway, so use that

    renamed to '_'; shell for maintainer scripts set back to /bin/sh
  * doc-base.sgml: update the FSF address
  * copyright: list myself as maintainer
  * bump standards version to 2.4.1.0 (checked)
  * add digit to version number: 0.7.x will be for hamm maintenance
    (branched); probably 0.8 will be for our documentation drafts
    including information on the Debian Document Hierarchy, the new docreg
    file format documentation and system, and other documents; 0.9 will
    probalby contain our implementations of these new infrastructures for
    slink; and eventually it'll all be a done deal and we'll hit 1.0.

  * fix minor problems with the new install-docs-man document id, the

  * improve the maintainer scripts immensely, trying to minimize removal,
    since it's not necessary to remove a document id when replacing it
  * doc-base.sgml: update TODO list

 -- Adam P. Harris <aph@debian.org>  Fri, 17 Apr 1998 01:17:06 -0400

doc-base (0.4) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * much better dhelp support: be sure to run 'dhelp_parse -d' before
    altering a .dhelp file, multiple <item>s in one .dhelp file, and very
    good parsing of existing .dhelp files in case more than one
    document-id is adding a files in the same directory (closes
    Bug#18808, Bug#20038, Bug#20529)
  * we now will modify even foreign .dhelp files
  * lowercase sections for dhelp (only), and remove leading 'Apps/', which
    is a workaround until we have a real, policy-specified and thought-out
    documentation hierarchy (closes Bug#20862)

  * debian/rules: clarifications and cleanup
  * added frozen to distribution ("oopsie" on last version)
  * install-docs is idempotent for --remove, that is, if you try to remove

    non-zero exit status (closes Bug#19875, I think)
